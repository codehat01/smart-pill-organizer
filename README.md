## System Overview

This system consists of two main parts:

1. **Hardware**: A dispensing unit controlled by an Arduino Nano.
2. **Software**: An Android app to configure and manage schedules.

The device operates as follows:

1. The user sets the schedule (morning, afternoon, night) using the Android app.
2. At the scheduled time, the dispenser:

   * Rotates the servo motor to dispense pills.
   * Plays a buzzer sound for a few seconds.
   * Updates the LCD display to show a reminder.

## Setup Instructions

### Hardware Assembly

1. **Connect the Components**:

   * Attach the HC-05 Bluetooth module to the Arduino Nano.
   * Connect the servo motor to the servo pin.
   * Wire the RTC DS3231 and LCD using the I2C interface.
   * Add the buzzer to the designated pin.

2. **Power Supply**:

   * Use a DC adapter with a buck converter to provide stable power to the system.

### Software Setup

1. Install **Arduino IDE**:

   * Install the required libraries: `Servo`, `Wire`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`, `RTClib`, and `SoftwareSerial`.
   * Upload the provided Arduino code to the Nano.

2. Install the Android App:

   * Build the app in **Android Studio** and install it on your smartphone.
   * Pair the phone with the HC-05 module.

## Usage

### Setting Timings

1. Open the Android app and connect to the dispenser via Bluetooth.
2. Set the desired timings for morning, afternoon, and night.
3. Save the schedule.

### Receiving Alerts

* At the scheduled time:

  * The servo motor rotates to dispense pills.
  * A buzzer sounds, and the LCD displays the reminder.
